# AJAR-Project
## Project Description
Plan+ (Plant) is designed for young adults and adults (ages 18-35) who want to stay organized and ensure that they achieve their goals. Plan+ allows users to set goals and keep track of the progress of their goals through viewing progress visualization, setting their schedule, and more. The data that this product will store is mainly user account information and user inputted data (plans, files, etc). Users will be able to upload, update, and view the data that they have inputted. Given enough time, a notification system could be implemented as well as a way to view other user profiles.
